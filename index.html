                        <div class="testimony">“My two daughters, now ages 16 and 13, have been going to Spazio Italiano
                            since they were toddlers. There, they grew up immersed in Italian songs, stories, food and
                            friendship. Through this immersive experience when they weee young they learned the Italian
                            language through play and later through structured grammar classes. As they have grown older
                            Spazio Italiano has become their second home. Ilaria Giannini is truly a gift to our family
                            and our community.” <span><em>Kristina </em></span>
                        </div>

                        <div class="testimony">“I have been taking my son Arlo to Spazio since he was 9 months old, he
                            is now 5 and it’s one of his favorite places to be! It is such a special environment for us.
                            It’s amazing to watch his Italian improve. Ilaria is so wonderful with all the children, she
                            is quick to think and act and handle any situation that may arise. All the kids are drawn to
                            her warm and loving nature.” <span><em>Valentina </em></span>
                        </div>

                        <div class="testimony">“My almost 3 year old son has thoroughly enjoyed Ilaria's group classes.
                            She is an engaging and fun teacher who exposes the kids to one of the world's most beautiful
                            languages through songs, books, and play. My son looks forward to seeing her every week, and
                            I've already signed him up for the fall!.” <span><em>Gina </em></span>
                        </div>


                        <div class="testimony">“If you wish your children to learn Italian in a warm, caring
                            environment, Spazio Italiano is the perfect place. Maestra Ilaria, a native of Rome, is not
                            only knowledgeable of the language but is also versed in teaching techniques for children of
                            different ages. Every morning my grandchildren attend Spazio, they are excited and eager to
                            go. Grazie, Maestra Ilaria!” <span><em>Nonna Alessandra </em></span>
