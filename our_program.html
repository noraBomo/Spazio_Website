            <p>All of our programs are based on learning through play in a fun, safe and stimulating environment. Italian cultural themes are explored through games, music, art, drama, books and cooking. </p>

            <p>
                By utilizing language learning activities and materials, academic instruction is achieved in a context that values a child’s natural playful tendencies and curiosities. This process is reinforced by carefully developed curriculums taught entirely by native speakers.
            </p>
            <h2>Morning Program</h2>
            <p>Age </p>
            <p> 9 months and  3 years must be with parent or caregiver
                3-5 years old </p>

            <p>The morning program provides a beautiful opportunity for young children with their parent to learn a new language through play. The use of stories, puppets, arts and crafts, games and songs are essential to creating a nurturing environment in which to participate, explore and experiment with the Italian language and culture.</p>
            
            <!-- add carousel/interactive image -->

            <P>Children will be immersed in the Italian language through play, class participation and social interaction. As a result, the students will develop self-confidence, expressing themselves in Italian as well as mastering other age appropriate skills. The activities will take place in a fun, safe environment where the toys, books and games are Italian.</P>

                An engaging way to explore and have fun together while learning Italian is through art. We will work on projects that reinforce the learning experience and give the children a chance to explore and experiment with different materials while still acquiring Italian.

            We offer wonderful cooking class projects where children can learn and practice new vocabulary.
            Last semester some of our culinary creations have included hand made pasta (tagliatelle), pizza margherita, Tiramisu’, polpette and gnocchi. Many of our cooking classes projects have found there way home to the dinner table!

        <section class="academic_program">
            <p>For the language courses we utilize creative writing, grammar and vocabulary games to learn Italian. Each child will keep their own Italian text book throughout the semester as way to track progress. To stimulate the children and help them better interact with themselves and each other we also play Italian games such as nascondino, rubabandiera, campana, caccia al tesoro and tombola. Engaging in interactive play helps the children learn the language and culture naturally.</p>
