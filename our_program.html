                <p class="mx-5 p2 intro-p2">All of our programs are based on learning through play in a fun, safe and
                    stimulating environment. Italian cultural themes are explored through games, music, art, drama,
                    books and cooking.
                    <br>By utilizing language learning activities and materials, academic instruction is achieved in a
                    context that values a child’s natural playful tendencies and curiosities. This process is reinforced
                    by carefully developed curriculums taught entirely by native speakers.

                <p class="mx-5 p2 intro-p2">The morning program provides a beautiful opportunity for young children with
                    their parent to learn a new language through play. The use of stories, puppets, arts and crafts,
                    games and songs are essential to creating a nurturing environment in which to participate, explore
                    and experiment with the Italian language and culture.</p>

                    participation and social interaction. As a result, the students will develop self-confidence,

                    each other we also play Italian games such as nascondino, rubabandiera, campana, caccia al tesoro
                    and tombola. Engaging in interactive play helps the children learn the language and culture
